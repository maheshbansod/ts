things to do

## Application

- [ ] Destructuring operator should be part of expression i guess

### Error stuff

- [ ] Maybe use token.clone instead of consuming after peek for where I do next and expect "Already peeked"
- [ ] Look at unexpected token cases and see if expected token cases can work better there.
- [ ] BUG - why errors of multiple unexpected token for the same token

## Non-application

- [ ] use cargo-make or just or something
- [ ] add README.md

## extr

- [ ] emit LLVM IR?
