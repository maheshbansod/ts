# Todo

things to do

## Application

### Error stuff

- [ ] Maybe use token.clone instead of consuming after peek for where I do next and expect "Already peeked"
- [ ] Look at unexpected token cases and see if expected token cases can work better there.

## Non-application

- [ ] use cargo-make or just or something
- [ ] add README.md
